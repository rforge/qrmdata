Marius,

this has been discussed in the CRAN team intensively and we got to the
following conclusion:


- the reason for having the 5 MB limit is that we do not want to waste
space on CRAN, distributing 20MB between 4 packages makes the Note
silent, but actually generates more overhead.

- there seem to be important reasons for having this on CRAN which
justifies to make an exception here

Therefore, we would accept this data collection, but only if you bundle
it in one package that is not updated more often than once a year,
ideally using a version number that shows the date of the latest data
update.

Best,
Uwe
