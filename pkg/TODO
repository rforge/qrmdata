In vignette:
1) Added Alex as author
2) Added
   - colnames(JPY_USD) <- "JPY/USD" # adjust accordingly
   - colnames(JPY_GBP) <- "JPY/GBP" # adjust accordingly
   and corrected the data accordingly (on R-Forge, but not on CRAN yet)
3) We should have the Danish fire insurance data set in qrmdata (see 'evir')
4) Rename ZCB_CA to ZCB_CAD and ZCB_US to ZCB_USD (consistency) + adapt vignette!
5) Change 'require' to 'library'
